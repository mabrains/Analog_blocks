# Aanlog_Blocks
* In our repo we demonstrate design and simulation of three analog blocks: -
    1. OTA
    2. Bandgap reference voltage
    3. LDO
* In each block you will find the schematic of the circuit, schematic of testbench, netlists, images and a readme.file
  tells you how to simulate the circuit using ngspice.
* We are working on the three blocks for now so this is not the final design.
