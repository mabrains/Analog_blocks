# Skywater 130nm Analog Blocks

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mabrains/sky130_ubuntu_setup/main/logo.svg" width="150">](http://mabrains.com/)

* In our repo we demonstrate design and simulation of following analog blocks: -
    1. OTA
    2. Bandgap reference voltage
    3. LDO
    4. DC to DC converter
* In each block you will find the schematic of the circuit, schematic of testbench, netlists, images and a readme.file
  tells you how to simulate the circuit using ngspice.
* We are working on the three blocks for now so this is not the final design.
